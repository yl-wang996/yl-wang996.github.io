I am a Master's student studying informatics at the University of Hamburg with an impressive GPA of 1.8, I'll graduate in about October 2024. My academic focus is on embodied multi-modal perception and control. And I have one paper accepted at IROS 2024.

My academic focus is on embodied multi-modal perception and control, specifically in the context of dexterous tool manipulation using multi-fingered hands. My Masterâ€™s thesis introduces a novel approach to dexterous tool manipulation through task and motion planning, the motion planner is with **Diffusion policy** and task planner is with the **Large Language Model**. Furthermore, I have developed a **VR-based teleoperation** pipeline for robotic data collection. 

My **IROS paper** has been done during my student research assistant phase at TAMS group of University of Hamburg, it introduces a novel approach for the **6D pose estimation** from partial points cloud based on the generative method, and it can simply the complecated manipulation of the multifingered hand robot, from 30-Dof to 6-Dof.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I have substantial experience with simulation environments, notably **Isaac NVIDIA** and **Mujoco**. I am proficient in robot control using **ROS** and **MoveIt** and have practical experience working with the **Shadowhand robot** and **UR/Diana robot arm**. Furthermore, my other background includes in NLP, LLM, pattern recognition, and signal processing. I have accumulated approximately two years of experience in industrial computer vision before my master's study.
