I am a proceeding Master's student  studying informatics at the University of Hamburg with an impressive GPA of 1.8, I am on track to graduate in October 2024. My academic focus is on embodied multi-modal perception and control and have scientific publication on top conference.

I have a keen interest in researching dexterous tool manipulation using multi-fingered hands. I have also published work on 6D pose estimation and am currently engaged in a project involving imitation learning.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I have substantial experience with simulation environments, notably Isaac Sim/Gym and Mujoco. I am proficient in robot control using ROS and MoveIt and have practical experience working with the Shadowhand robot and its accompanying robotic arm. Furthermore, my other background includes in NLP, LLM, pattern recognition, and signal processing.
