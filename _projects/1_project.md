        <p class="text-justify">
Our project focuses on the development of a robotic system capable of playing musical notes and chords on a marimba. The system integrates various  echnologies, including optical music recognition, audio command processing, and precise motion control. It employs a custom vision model to read musical  otes from a whiteboard and utilizes voice recognition to interpret human commands, and finally evaluates the robotâ€™s performance with audio feedback. The project encompasses hardware components, including 3D-printed compliant mechanisms and servomotors, to mimic human-like mallet strikes. This multifaceted project demonstrates the fusion of robotics, music, computer vision, and audio processing, showcasing a robot capable of performing a complex musical instrument with precision. The entire project, including code and documentation, can be found on [<a href="https://github.com/UHHRobotics22-23/MarimbaBot">Github</a> | <a href="https://tams.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/lehre/2023ss/projekt/ir/doc/marimbabot-slides.pdf">Slides</a> | <a href="https://tams.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/lehre/2023ss/projekt/ir/doc/marimbabot-report.pdf">Paper</a>].
